### How does it work?

The Component Designer uses a [source generator](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-c-source-generators/) to find any calls to `Discord.ComponentDesigner.cx`, using a [custom parser](./src/Discord.Net.ComponentDesigner.Parser/) parse the syntax, validates the structure against Discord's component contraints, and if everything looks good then an [interceptor](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/main/docs/features/interceptors.md) is emitted, replacing the `cx` call with the Discord.Net component builder strucutre.

### Getting started

TODO

## Component Syntax

The syntax for writing components is based off of JSX, and is referred as 'CX' within the codebase.

### Elements

An element consists of a name, some attributes, and some children:
```xml
<Example />
<Example foo="bar" />
<Parent>
    <Child1 />
    Some text
    <Child2 />
    {DateTime.UtcNow}
</Parent>
```

Valid children of an element are:
- Another element.
- Text
- Interpolations

### Attributes

Attributes consist of a name and an optional value, valid values can be:
- A string literal.
- An interpolation


```xml
<Example
    foo="abc"
    bar='def{123}'
    baz={123}
    switch1
    switch2
/>
```

### String literals

String literals are text and/or interpolations wrapped in quotes. You can either use a single quote or a double quote to denote a string literal. The quote character can be used to simply escapes; double quotes don't need to be escaped in a single-quote literal, and vice versa.

```js
'my string'
"my other string with 'single quotes'"
'escaped \' quotes \''
```

### Escape characters

escaping rules for the syntax are based off of the C# string they're contained in, for example if you're in a multi-line string literal with 3 quotes, you don't need to escape a single quote within the syntax, but if you're in a simple string literal, you may need to.

For the CX language specific escape control, you can use `\` to escape characters.


### Interpolation Syntax

String interpolation is controlled by the C# syntax, and is parsed based off of what C# says is an interpolation. 

Using multiple dollar signs on the containing string to control interpolation character count is supported by the syntax.

# Component Designer

The component designer is class `Discord.ComponentDesigner` contains the `cx` methods used to write components. It's recommended to import the class statically for shorter inline use of CX:
```cs
using static Discord.ComponentDesigner;

// you can now just call 'cx'
var myAwesomeComponent = cx(...);
```


## String Interpolation

You can use string interpolations to inject values almost anywhere

```cs
using static Discord.ComponentDesigner;

var buttonId = "my-custom-id";
var label = "my label";

var button = cx(
   $"""
    <button customId={buttonId}>
        {label}
    </button>
    """
);
```

> [!NOTE]
> You can't use string interpolations for element identifiers

Most components have constraints on what type of value is allowed (ex select.min should be an integer) and diagnostics will be reported on type mismatches

```tsx
<select
  min={1} // OK
  max={"this isn't a number"} // Error: 'String' is not of expected type 'int'
/>
```

> [!NOTE]
> non-constant values passed into interpolation arguments usually have a runtime fallback (ex `int.Parse`). In the future, you'll be able to enable/disable theses fallbacks and treat them as compile errors.

## Interpolated Components

Using string interpolation, you can also supply components as children:

```cs
using static Discord.ComponentDesigner;

var myComponent = cx("<text>Hello</text>");

var myOtherComponent = cx(
   $"""
    <container>
        {myComponent}
        <separator />
        <text>World</text>
    </container>
    """
);
```

Valid types of interpolated components are:

- `Discord.IMessageComponentBuilder`
- `Discord.IMessageComponent`
- `Discord.MessageComponent`
- `Discord.CXMessageComponent`
- Any collection type implementing `IEnumerable<T>` of the previous types.

> [!NOTE]
> By using interpolated components, some compile-time checks can't be done, these include but are not limited to:
>
> - child length checks (ex action row children)
> - child component type (ex text in action row)

## Compile-time Diagnostics

The generator for the Component Designer comes with compile-time diagnostics for validating most constraints of components, example diagnostics include:

- label/description lengths
- correct types of nested components
- property type validation
- required properties

These are provided as roslyn analyzer diagnostics and can be enabled/disabled using that flow.

```jsx
<row>
    <text>Hello!</text> // Error: 'row' cannot contain 'text' components
    <button /> // Error: A button must specify either a 'customId' or 'url'
    <button customId="abc" /> // Error: A button must have a 'label' or 'emoji' 
</row>
```


## Reusable Custom Components

You can define basic custom components which can be used within the CX syntax. As of now, there is only one type way of writing a custom component, and that is a functional component. In future versions there are plans for more component types and ways of writing components.

### Functional components

A functional component is a function that is:
- `static`.
- either `public` or `internal`.
- returns a valid interpolation component type.

Functional components can have zero to many arguments, with limited support for compile-time validation against them. Some primitive argument types (string, int, emoji, etc) can make use of the CX syntax, but any complex or non-standard argument types must be supplied using [string interpolation](#string-interpolation)

```cs
using static Discord.ComponentDesigner;

var user = new User(name: "Example");

var component = cx(
   $"""
    <container>
        <SayHello user={user} />
    </container>
    """
)

public static CXMessageComponent SayHello(User user)
    => cx(
       $"""
        <text>
            Hello, {user.Name}!
        </text>
        """
    );
```

> [!TIP]
> You can use default values for parameters to indicate an optional property.

#### Functional components with children

It is possible to take in children of a component using the `CXChildren` attribute, children are treated the same way that parameters as props are handles, but with a few key differences:
- Built-in conversion for text -> type (colors, ints, etc) is not supported.
- Children types that are not a string or valid component type are only allowed to be supplied by interpolation.

You can specify the cardinality of the number of children you wish to support by using a collection type, any non-collection type will only support a single child.

```cs
using static Discord.ComponentDesigner;

var user = new User(Name: "Example", Avatar: null);

var component = cx(
   $"""
    <container>
        <MaybeIcon url={user.Avatar}>
            <text>
                Hello, {user.Name}
            </text>
        </MaybeIcon>
    </container>
    """
);

public static CXMessageComponent MaybeIcon(
    string? url,
    [CXChildren] CXMessageComponent children
) {
    if (url is null) return children;

    return cx(
       $"""
        <section>
            {children}
            <accessory>
                <thumbnail url={url} />
            </accessory>
        </section>
        """
    );
}
```

### Component cardinality

Some accepted component types have default cardinality, such as `CXMessageComponent` allowing more than one component. This can restrict and effect custom components with children, specifying which component type you accept as children controls how many child components can be supplied to your custom component.

| Type                     | Cardinality |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| CXMessageComponent       | Many        |
| MessageComponent         | Many        |
| IMessageComponent        | One         |
| IMessageComponentBuilder | One         |

Wrapping any of these types in a collection type gives it a cardinality of many, as well as ensuring that the collection represents the actual children supplied to your component.

> [!NOTE]
> Splatting is automatically handled by the generator, an interpolation collection of components is unwrapped and supplied to your child type.
